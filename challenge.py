# # sorta like a hangman game structure
# # 3 ways to do it
# # -have a dictionary of alphabet and the puzzle and check if the guess matches the puzzle
# #  /alphabet pair. Return correct letter
# # -have them solve the puzzle totally and return a true/False
# # -have the guess and fill in what was right
# alphabet={1:'A',2:'B',5:'L'}

# puzzle=['A']

# puzzle_2='N______ C__ S___\nT__ U_ A__ F___'
# puzzle_2_answer='NOTHING CAN STOP\nTHE U.S. AIR FORCE'

# print('H'in puzzle_2_answer)
